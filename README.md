# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn PredictionOverview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Dataset- Source: Telecom customer data (can specify if it's public like Kaggle's Telecom Churn dataset)
- Features: Includes customer demographics, usage patterns, service subscriptions, complaints, etc.
- Target: Churn (Yes/No indicating if customer churned)

Objectives- Build predictive models to identify churn likelihood
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall
- Provide insights for business retention strategies

Technologies Used- Python: Core language for analysis
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (or others used)

Key Steps1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categoricals
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights on churn factors
3. Model Building & Evaluation: Trained models with performance metrics
4. Interpretation: Feature importance for business actions

Usage- Clone the repo and install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run notebooks for EDA and model training
